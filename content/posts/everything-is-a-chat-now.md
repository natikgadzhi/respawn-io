# Everything is a chat now

Caught myself thinking, how many “AI“ chats can I name, and how do I personally think about what makes a useful LLM app, and a shitty one?

- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Raycast
- Kagi FastGPT
- Devin (yes, it has a chat)
- lambda.chat
- HuggingChat
- Cursor / Zed Agentic AI / Copilot
- Github Copilot (on github.com, in the context of a repo)
