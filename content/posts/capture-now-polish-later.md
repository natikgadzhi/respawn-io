# Capture Now, Improve Later

It's pretty common for great mid-career engineers to go MIA when they're supposed to share a design document, or just
when you expect them to make a pull request with a feature, after they've already demonstrated a quick tracer bullet /
proof of concept implementation.

<WithAside>
Usually, the culprit is they want it to be perfect. They don't want to "Waste team's time on review if it's not fully
ready yet", or they don't feel safe working in the open or making mistakes.

<Aside>
Guess who's job it is to ensure people [[remote-team-health-check|feel safe and comfortable sharing their work drafts and general opinions]]? Yep, yours, dear engineering leader. _Culture is what people do when you're not watching._
</Aside>

As an eng leader, you, on the other hand, are likely coaching them to share their work early and iterate quickly,
include the team as much as possible. That fosters trust, collaboration, and all that.

Surprising absolutely no one, I have a "Do as I say not as I do" situation in that regard with writing. I want to write
a few great posts a year, putting in writing the list of big milestones in my own growth, solid advice for people in
similar positions. But it doesn't just work that way.

And since this website is, well, a custom app — nothing stops me from making some posts _placeholders_. The kernel of
thought might be here, captured quickly, but some additional context might be required — and it's fine to fill in the
blanks later.
