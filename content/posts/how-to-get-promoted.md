# How to get promoted faster

## Context

* You get paid for the job that you already do, not the job that you _want_ to do in the future. If you want to be promoted to the next level, you need to consistently perform at that level for a quarter or longer.
* Companies generally suck at promoting you at the right time. Either you're in a startup and promotions feel concervative, or you're in a FAANG company and they're overly political. /shrug

## Leveling

* I'll assume some general leveling compatible with most companies, ranging from L2 junior to L5 staff+. Your company will have different levels. Learn them and understand the biggest differentiators in behaviors, types of impact, and scope of work between levels.
* At junior levels, good companies _expect_ that you will grow within a certain time period. That's because your true impact unleashes when you level up and stay at the company. Your promotions are _expected_ and you have to show up and provide enough evidence to back them up.

## Things in your control

<WithAside>
You don't have to rely on your manager to figure out your growth trajectory, make a growth plan, and advocate for you every step of the way. It is their job, sure, but you don't have to slow down _your_ growth just because they prioritized different things, are learning, or generally not great.

<Aside>[[understand-the-context|Making your work visible]] is generally helpful in putting together a statement like “Look at me, I'm outperforming my level and need a promotion yesterday”.</Aside>
</WithAside>

Your manager should generally ensure you have a _growth plan_, they should advocate for _great things you made_ and _make your impact visible_, and then they would put together a _promotion package_, that is mostly a fancy word for a document describing why they think you're eligible for the next promotion.

But if you understand leveling in your company, and with some help from your peers and a mentor, you can work on all three of these areas. This will also be a stellar managing-up exercise — you will do most of your own growth work for your manager, they'd have to only course-correct it. AND it would also help your manager help everybody else on your team, since they can now apply the same patterns and perhaps even document templates that you made for yourself.

Taking ownership over your growth trajectory is in itself a "senior" behavior, it raises a level above just getting programming work done.

## The growth plan

* Danger: this is not a checklist. You don't get promoted automagically when you check all the boxes.
