# Pain Is a Part of the Process

It's like those Russian-Jewish ballet teachers. If your feet aren't bleeding, you're not doing it right.

- If you don't feel you need to ask your mentor for advice every now and then, you're not challenging yourself enough.
- If your team doesn't make decisions that turn out to be suboptimal and learn from them, you're not delegating enough.
- If your team never disagrees with you, you're not challenging the team enough.
- If you never have a "made progress towards expectation" performance review, your manager is not challenging you enough.

You 👏 won't 👏 grow 👏 without 👏 stetch 👏 goals.
