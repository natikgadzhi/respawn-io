# Preparing for Hiring Manager Interviews

Every interview pipeline is different, although there are common patterns. In my companies, hiring manager interview is the first one after the recruiter screen.

Somehow I'm sure this is going to be a spicy take, but if you want to pass the interview, you should invest time and research the company and the position. 

_But the interview loop already takes 6 hours!!!11_ — yeah, I know, and you will waste them if you don't invest another hour into some basic preparation that would help you in every interview along the way.

> Generally, researching folks you meet with, what they're working on and what they're looking for is a good skill to have. 11/10, highly recommended.

* **Research the company**. The basics: their products, what makes them unique in their market, their competitor products, their rough team size, their funding data.
    * If you carefully drop “Congratulations on your round, $43m sounds like a great runway boost for the team size! Any exciting growth plans?” — it would likely land great. Unless you get the numbers and timeline wrong, than it's just awkward and shows you didn't care.
