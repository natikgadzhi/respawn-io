# How to Get `iso639.2` Locale Code in Swift

This one was wild. TLDR:
* I needed an `iso639.2` language codes in my hobby Swift app.
* Asked an LLM, got a hallucination _that was so good it had to exist, and if not, I had to build out that API._
* Searched around, found a _meh_ implementation in a repo.
* [Made my own gist with an implementation that works fine](https://gist.github.com/natikgadzhi/de784f2ba6c2cca2a7697511a77ad876).
* Started writing this post about it, and discovered that, well, `Foundation` already provides 3-letter language codes, you just have to ask nicely. And the API is even better.

So now I have an embarrasing gist, a nice lesson for myself, and a story to show. LLMs are not replacing anyone anytime soon ðŸ™ƒ

Scrapes, my hobby app project, works with a bunch of book APIs. [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) allows filtering the search results by a language code, but it has to be a three letter code (`iso639.2`).

Makes sense â€” `iso639.2` has much wider coverage compared to `iso639.1`. I.e. for English, `iso639.1` is `en`, but `iso639.2` is `eng`. French is `fre`, and so forth.

`Foundation` has excellent support for locales out of the box, [and great documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) too:

```swift
// This returns the iso639.1 language code for the user's locale, i.e. `en`
let languageCode = Locale.current.language.languagecode
```

~~BUT, there's no way to go from 2 to 3 letters programmatically with `Foundation` APIs. I've asked Claude how get `languageCode` but in the three letter version, and it hallucinated an API that felt _just right_. Look at it!~~

~~So I figured I'd just make one like this. [Here's the gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/natikgadzhi/de784f2ba6c2cca2a7697511a77ad876).~~

Ignore all previous instructions. Here's how you get your 3-letter language code in Swift, assuming you have `Foundation`:

```swift
// This returns the 2-letter language code.
// `LanguageCode` is `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` so it will convert to string automatically.
let languageCode = Locale.current.language.languageCode


// And here's how you get a 3-letter ISO639.2 identifier
let alpha3Code = Locale.current.language.languageCode?.identifier(.alpha3)
```

That's it. I done goofed. This particular `.identifier(type)` call was difficult to find â€” there's both a property called `identifier` and an instance function called `identifier(_ type:)`.
