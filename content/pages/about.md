# Hi! I'm Natik

I'm a builder and a tinkerer at heart, a software engineer by training, and I'm fascinated by how people learn, grow, and organize into groups to build things together and have fun.

I work in engineering leadership at λ [Lambda](https://lambda.ai). We're providing GPU infrastructure to folks who train and finetune their models, and inference platforms to those who run them.

Before that, I was an engineering manager at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com), where we made a [source available](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) data engineering toolkit for ELT / ELTP pipelines. I was responsible for the [Connector Builder and our long tail of connectors](/posts/airbyte-2024-in-review).

I write about engineering leadership, building software, and finding out. The
