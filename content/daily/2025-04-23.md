title: Raycast pushes AI as a sales channel
meta_description: Raycast launches yet another AI chat product on raycast.ai, joining the commoditization bloodbath instead of showcasing their unique local tools

Raycast, my favorite _app launcher_ for Mac OS, shipped https://raycast.ai â€” an LLM chat demo with a bunch of signup prompts. I can probably name 20 chat / research / knowledge base search products out there, and they all are roughly the same thing.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a paid user on an annual plan for this thing, with AI bells and whistles included. But why does raycast.ai exist on it's own is beyond me. There _are better chats_ that are free (ahem, https://lambda.chat), and it does not really demonstrate why Raycast itself is so cool (local ask-style tools with highly specialized Raycast models).

This commoditization is going to be a bloodbath.
