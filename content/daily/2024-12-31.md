Was writing a few posts this week, and finally got tired of running `contentlayer2 dev` and `next dev` in two split panes.

So, I added a new script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "pnpm run contentlayer dev --parallel 'next dev'"
  }
}
```

Was really tempting to bring Overmind from my Rails days, but this works.
