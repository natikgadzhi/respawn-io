TIL there are `beforeprint` and `afterprint` events on `window` in Javascript, so
you can manipulate the DOM to make the print version look nicer beyond what you
can do with print styles in CSS.

Especially helpful to hide a 3rd-party iframe (in our case, Intercom widget)
that otherwise caused the printed page to overflow horizontally.
