meta_description: SymbolKit has a CLI tool to combine multiple symbols.json files, enabling Swift DocC to resolve cross-module documentation links
---

[SymbolKit](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-symbolkit) has a
[nice little command line utility](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-symbolkit/blob/main/Sources/dump-unified-graph/DumpUnifiedGraph.swift)
that takes several `symbols.json` for multuple modules as inputs, and combines
them into a chonkier `symbols.json`, so that later Swift DocC can resolve \`\`
links in DocC comments between symbols in those separate module graphs.
