meta_description: Sidekiq once had a table flip method in its codebase that got replaced with zen - a fun piece of Ruby gem history and developer humor
---

I was working on a bringing [Crons](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) support for [`sidekiq-scheduler` in `sentry-ruby`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/2172) a couple days back, and found this [*gem of a method*](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/ed9e01d427ed0503caa73191e32ff18a86e9f35e/lib/sidekiq.rb#L44).

Turns out, Sidekiq had the table flip method [for a while](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/commit/12b1b30147e2cd0ecc86345d388e0c08e827fa9f#diff-2eecd3565b38823c09513903afa6686627d3ba8d883d520d3a83db61375e5dde), but the tech bro debauchery got replaced with zen and calmness.
