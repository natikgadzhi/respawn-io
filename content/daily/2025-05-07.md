Catching up on newsletters, I love [the mind meld idea](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/p/a-weekly-mind-meld?publication_id=991131&post_id=162489618&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=true&r=8s83&triedRedirect=true).

> It's how I continually open up my thoughts to the team with a long-term goal to reduce any mental alignment gap between us. I like to think that the more I share, the more they can understand what I believe is important and why.

I love short, async project updates that follow a consistent structure, but reading the essay, I looked at it from a new angle: it's a newsletter, or a blog, but for folks that you work with. You care that they read it, so you want to make it interesting, engaging, flowing well, and concise (under 1500 words). Especially if you support a team of teams (or a larger org), this is such a great tool to have.
