meta_description: Lattice supports CMD+K keyboard shortcuts for quickly jumping to people and 1:1s - a delightful productivity feature for performance management

[Lattice](https://latticehq.com) supports keyboard shortcuts! Try `⌘+K`, it's
magic. So cool to be able to jump to a person (and the 1:1 logs and agenda
items) instead of looking for them in the sidebar. Thank you, Lattice FE team!
