title: Next.js is smart about what port to start on, and it's very cool!
meta_description: Next.js automatically finds an available port when 3000 is taken, gracefully starting on 3001 - a small but thoughtful developer experience feature
---
I won't take the prize on the biggest fan of Next.js competition, but I just noticed a thing!

```bash
~/src/respawn-io main *6 !1 ?1 ❯ next dev
 ⚠ Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
Contentlayer config change detected. Updating type definitions and data...
  ▲ Next.js 13.5.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3001
  - Environments: .env.local

 ✓ Ready in 6.7s
```

If you start your Next app with `next dev`, but your default port 3000 is already taken, it'll just gracefully start on 3001, saving you a few minutes of stopping whatever was there. This is so cool! 👏🏼
