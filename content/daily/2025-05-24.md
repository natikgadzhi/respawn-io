I've used Tide for a long time, but it spams my `fish_variables.fish` on every command, and I didn't want to deal with that in dotfiles. So I switched to `pure-fish/pure`, and that got annoying quickly, because the git prompt pieces are slow to render.

So heads up â€” you're supposed to install `fish-async-prompt` to go with that, it makes things show up instantly.

Here's my current plugin list anyway:

```shell
jorgebucaran/fisher
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
jethrokuan/z
pure-fish/pure
acomagu/fish-async-prompt
patrickf1/fzf.fish
```
