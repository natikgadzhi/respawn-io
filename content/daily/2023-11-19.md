meta_description: Contentlayer supports MDX and markdown formatting in frontmatter fields, but requires careful handling for rendering vs raw text usage

Contentlayer [supports markdown and even MDX](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/reference/source-files/field-types-defe41e9#mdx) formatting in the frontmatter fields of your documents, as long as you specify the field type as `mdx` or `markdown`.

The tricky part is that:
- `markdown` fields give you raw HTML code. You'd have to wrap it in `__dangerouslySetHTML` or something.
- `mdx` gives you the code that you have to pass into `useMDXComponent` to render.
- Either way, you have to decide where to allow markdown formatting and where to strip it.

I've just implemented it for the blog [here](https://github.com/natikgadzhi/respawn-io/commit/8d1acb8f756c8803ff32391564f5e16a2ce735ae):
- Posts lists gets new `PostDescription` component that renders MDX-processed post description.
- Post metadata and RSS gets raw description, implemented in a little custom field on Contentlayer that strips formatting.
