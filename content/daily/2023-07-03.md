Turns out, _modern frontend people_ have two things called `tsx`. One is just
for the Typescript + components file format. The other one is for
[this little library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) that makes Node play
somewhat nice with ESM.

I've long wanted to move the RSS generator into a script, tried a few times, and
it always hurt. Of course it
[hurt this time](https://github.com/natikgadzhi/respawn-io/commit/4ae08c6235ee67c843e58e0d2ebb8353e36c4abc#diff-f0ab2dc999c7ae9d46aa9f9e2e0b126c641bef78add247cc916fd1cfe4f351fe),
too.
